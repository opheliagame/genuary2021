# Genuary2021
Experiments made during genuary2021

# my thoughts and progress
Even though I could not complete all the days of the challenge, I found it extremely rewarding to participate. The prompts very quite thought provoking, and it was a welcoming change to not have to think about what to do every day. The code is in the least, somewhat spaghetti, but I hope to improve it sooner than later. Hoping to be able to try all prompts next year!

# GENUARY? 
GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

It happens during the month of January 2021.

For every 24 hour day within this 744 hour timespan, we have prepared a prompt with instructions for you to execute.

You don’t have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y’know, we put effort into this.

You can use any language, framework or medium. Please respect the Geneva Conventions.

Share your work and tag it with #genuary and #genuary2021. If you’re going to misspell it as #genaury, please go all in and include all permutations.
